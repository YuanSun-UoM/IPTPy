==========================

Introduction
--------------------------

Thank you for considering contributing to ``IPTpy``! There are many ways to contribute to this project, including reporting bugs, requesting additional or new functionality, improving our documentation, or contributing your code and we appreciate all of them. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/YuanSun-UoM/IPTpy/discussions). 

## Where to start

Look through our open issues and see if there is anything you would like to take on! We recommend working with core developers to implement new functionality. We can help you get started and make sure your code is consistent with the rest of
the project. We do not officially "assign" issues to contributors, but if you are interested in working on an issue, please comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it. This will help us avoid duplicate work.

The code for ``IPTpy`` is hosted on GitHub. If you do not have one, you will need to create a [free GitHub account]( <https://github.com/signup/free>). The [GitHub Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) is a great place to get started with Git and GitHub.
